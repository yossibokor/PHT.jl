This package provides an implementation of the Persistent Homology Transform, as defined in [Persistent Homology Transform for Modeling Shapes and Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1030). 


## Installation
Currently, the best (only) way to install PHT is to run the following in `Julia`:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(PersistentHomologyTransfer)
```

## Inputs
PHT computes the Persistent Homology Transform of simple, closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ given a CSV file of ordered points sample from the curve in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. You need to also specify a number of directions to use for the PHT.

```julia
PHT(points, number_of_directions)
```

which outputs an array of [Eirene](https://github.com/Eetion/Eirene.jl) Persistence Diagrams, one for each direction. 

The directions are automatically generated by
```julia
angles = [n*pi/(number_of_directions/2) for n in 1:number_of_directions]
directions = [[cos(x), sin(x)] for x in angles]
```
